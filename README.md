FreeBSD-Ports
=============

A collection of FreeBSD ports, created from scratch or updated from the official ports collection.
In either case, I will try to get ports added to the FreeBSD ports collection,
but since it is a process that may take a significant amount of time, in the meantime I host them here
in case they are useful to other people.

Currently, the list of ports is the following:

  * sysutils/fswatch-file-change-monitor @1.4.5.1
  * www/glassfish @4.1
